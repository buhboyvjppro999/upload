    <String ID="354240">How do you know him?</String>
    <String ID="354241">Touss--[coughing]Roussillon saved my life once, long ago. I figured I owed him, so I helped him expand his "business”. The Ol’ Devil showed me a few tricks too, taught me his trade, if you will.&lt;br&gt;‘Course, I do all the work!</String>

    <String ID="354270">Ah. Your blowpipe... A beautiful weapon. One of the finest I ever made. I remember the day that coward, Agaté, stole it. Fitting he should remain too spineless to face me. But I have captured his pawn. Now he will be forced from hiding!</String>
    <String ID="354271">How... do you know Agaté?</String>
    <String ID="354272">So he is here, as I suspected. Agaté was my disciple once. If not for that thieving woman--</String>
    <String ID="354273">Who are you really? The true Mackandal burned at the stake.</String>
    <String ID="354274">I see you know your history. Very well... François Mackandal was my mentor. And an Assassin. But he failed. She betrayed us and he died. I won’t make that mistake before I carry out his life’s destiny.</String>

    <String ID="354321">And I, to that drunk I call a business partner. I am glad to have met you, Aveline.</String>
    <String ID="354325">Agaté, I have done as you asked. The imposter is dead.&lt;br&gt;He was working with de Ferrer.</String>
    <String ID="354326">What else have you learned?</String>
    <String ID="354327">Only... that he would have forced you out of hiding.</String>
    <String ID="354328">Let us be thankful it did not come to that--if it had, our Brotherhood... Well, let us not dwell. You have destroyed the hornet’s nest in the bayou. At least for now... De Ferrer will have his day.</String>
    <String ID="354335">Aveline! Agaté warned me of your flight to Mexico. Do you intend to abandon your business, and the slaves in New Orleans? What about your family?</String>
    <String ID="354336">My father sends me to Cuba to find suppliers with his blessing. And you’re more than fit to run the business in my absence. I must follow our enemy.</String>
    <String ID="354337">And when were you going to tell me?</String>
    <String ID="354338">I couldn’t risk you trying to stop me.</String>
    <String ID="354339">Is this all you see in me? Business? Orders? Aveline, I care for you!</String>
    <String ID="354341">Gérald, don’t be angry. You know we cannot mix... feelings... with work. I had hoped to spare--</String>
    <String ID="354342">Since I know I cannot stop you, is there any last assistance I can provide?</String>
    <String ID="354343">I admit, my plan to board this ship is clumsy. </String>
    <String ID="354344">There’s a compound nearby, where slaves are held--slaves bound to Mexico. You can gain access to the ship by blending with them.</String>
    <String ID="354345">I won’t be able to take my weapons.</String>
    <String ID="354346">How will you defend yourself?</String>
    <String ID="354348">Right. Silly question. I’ll hold them for you until your return.</String>
    <String ID="354351">Thank you, Gérald. You’re a true, true friend.</String>
    <String ID="354367">Welcome, friends, to a new life of freedom, productivity, and peace! Here you will find no shackles, no whips. You will build your own community, and by your labor, together we will prosper!</String>
    <String ID="354374">Aveline! What a joy to see you here, and share the bounty of our life with a new sister! But why have you come? Were you not free already?</String>
    <String ID="354375">When I... heard how wonderful this community is, I had to see for myself. Are the rumors true? Are you as happy as they say?</String>
    <String ID="354376">Happier! Our homes are comfortable. Food is good and plentiful. It’s like Eden!</String>
    <String ID="354377">Are you paid a good wage?</String>
    <String ID="354378">We are allowed to live here, and participate in the community, each of us helping in our own way. That’s all the wage we need.</String>
    <String ID="354379">So the community owns this land?</String>
    <String ID="354380">Some day we might, once we earn out our contracts. They say the land is valuable, so it may take a long time. It will be worth it.</String>
    <String ID="354381">And if you should wish to leave?</String>
    <String ID="354382">It doesn’t happen. No one would ever want that.</String>
    <String ID="354383">No one has ever left?</String>
    <String ID="354384">Shh... You shouldn’t talk like that. No one here does. We’re so full of happiness, we have no need of unpleasant thoughts--or of those who would stir them.</String>
    <String ID="354385">It really is so wonderful to see you again. Good day.</String>

    <String ID="354391">Mmm... I prefer hunting.</String>
    <String ID="354392">That’s... unusual. But you will find yourself in good company. Our dig site leader is also a woman. If you can get along with her, you’ll do well here. Of course, everyone does well here. Our strength is using your strength!</String>

    <String ID="354399">Sorry.</String>

    <String ID="354441">Your locket... It’s very unusual. I’ve seen one before... I assumed it was one of a kind.</String>
    <String ID="354442">It is one of a kind. My mother made it with her own hands. You must be mistaken.</String>
    <String ID="354443">No... The woman who wore the locket was named Jeanne. She was one of the first workers to come here. I remember her fondly.</String>
    <String ID="354444">That was my mother’s name! Where is this woman? I must see her.</String>
    <String ID="354445">I don’t know. She lived in a private house at the south edge of the camp.</String>
    <String ID="354446">You should go. De Ferrer will be looking for you. Will you be alright on your own?</String>
    <String ID="354447">Yes. I will hide until the changing of the guard at sundown, and then make my escape again. This time, they won’t catch me.</String>

    <String ID="354718">Aveline, old girl! Where you been? The swamp’s not the same without you. The gators are getting uppity!</String>
    <String ID="354719">Oh, you know... business demands and piano recitals...</String>
    <String ID="354721">How I’ve missed the Bayou air. It has the scent of action about it!</String>
    <String ID="354722">Among other things...[after a beat, serious, confiding] Listen, I’m glad you’re here. The other day, I saw something, and I said to myself, Élise, old girl, there's something not right... Convoys, loaded with the strangest cargo: People. Dozens of them.</String>
    <String ID="354723">Where were they headed?</String>
    <String ID="354724">I can’t say. But I know where they came from: the Fort.</String>
    <String ID="354725">Will you show me the place?</String>
    <String ID="354726">Thought you’d never ask! Meet me tomorrow. I’ll mark your map.</String>

    <String ID="354740">Élise! What are you doing here?</String>
    <String ID="354741">What does it look like? Rescuing you.</String>
    <String ID="354742">From what? Employment? Freedom?</String>
    <String ID="354743">Er... Chrisfait, these chains don’t exactly say “freedom” to me.</String>
    <String ID="354744">Temporary discomforts. Too many workers escaped the last voyage without paying their fare. We’ll be released once we reach the work site.</String>
    <String ID="354745">These terms don’t concern you?</String>
    <String ID="354746">Élise, everything in this life concerns me. But I can survive a little longer, ‘til we get south to freedom.</String>

    <String ID="354749">But--</String>
    <String ID="354750">We should investigate the fort while the time is ripe. With all the soldiers in town, there can’t be many left.</String>

    <String ID="354757">Right... Thanks.</String>
    <String ID="354761">Now’s our best chance. The highest ranking man I’ve seen is a [SP]teniente (lieutenant). He’s lightly protected, but the fort is so big, we’ll need to be smart to find him.</String>
